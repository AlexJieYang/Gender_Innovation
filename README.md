# Female scientists produce more novel and disruptive ideas yet receive less citation impact
Abstract
Using a large dataset of 1.1 million scientists and 6.2 million research papers from 1990 to 2016 across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, we investigate gender differences in scientific impact, novelty, and disruption. We employ multivariable GLM regression methods to compare the contributions of female and male scientists, focusing on instances where they are either the first or last author. Our findings reveal that female scientists generate more novel ideas and are more likely to disrupt scientific paradigms, yet receive fewer citations than their male counterparts. This underscores a systemic underestimation and bias against the impact of female scientists' work. Further analysis indicates that this gender bias is consistent across time and career stages, and is more pronounced in large teams and prestigious institutions. Our results suggest the need for policies to counteract these biases and advocate for a more equitable evaluation system in scientific research.
